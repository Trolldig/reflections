When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm working together with others and want to share my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I don't want it to conflict with my code. I want to decide when I'm ready to update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks only happen on Github. On a local repository it is called clone. Branches are repositories with different versions of the code. I use fork if I want to have a clone of repository which I can share with friends. If its only for me I rather clone it. I use branches if I want to experiment with my existing code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can see what you have changed since pulling/pushing the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Managementtools like Trello. Diff could be used, but it would be harder without automatic version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I'm not finished with the change when commiting and I don't want to have a conflict with an other person which might make a similiar change. If you change directly on the master branch you don't have to deal with merging errors.
